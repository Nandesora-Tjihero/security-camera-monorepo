# Security Camera Mobile

This is a companion app to the monitoring [Security Camera](https://github.com/Ombuweb/security-camera) app. It is made with NativeScript-Vue.

## Prerequisites

The app uses Firebase so you need to have a Firebase created with at least an Android app registered.

To run the project on your machine, follow these steps:

1. If you haven't, setup your NativeScript local dev following [Local setup](https://docs.nativescript.org/setup/#local-setup) docs.
2. Clone the repo to your machine and do this:

- `cd security-camera-mobile`
- `npm i`
- `ns run android`, I've not test the app on iOS yet. When I do, I'll update the README.
